60 million years of large herbivores ecological transitions unveiled by Network Analysis

Functional transitions are key to understanding the evolution of ecosystems over deep time. The fossil record provides direct evidence for the behavior of biological systems over evolutionary time. In doing so, paleontological information becomes a key source of parallels/analog for current and future ecosystem processes, including crucial transitions to new ecological states, and systems recovery. Using network analysis over a new dataset of worldwide large herbivores spanning the last 60 Myrs, we found that large herbivore communities experienced long periods of ecological stability interrupted by abiotic driven reorganizations. There was an initial trend to increase the functional diversity, fueled by the formation of the Gomphotherium landbridge around 21 Ma, when the system experienced a first reorganization. This natural corridor facilitated the interchange of faunas between Eurasia and Africa, opening up new opportunities to explore diverse functionalities in novel environments. After this moment, there was stability until the functional system collapsed around 10 Ma coinciding with the spread of C4 dominated grasslands. This event came from a trend to a more arid and cold world, that affected the vegetation and the animals that feed on them. From then, the system never recovered a positive trend in functional diversity, accelerating their decline around 2.5 Ma during the beginning of Plio-Pleistocene glaciations. However, this continuous decay did not have an effect on the functional structure which remained unaltered through the last 10 Ma.
